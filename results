{"username":"Su Baru","fishingExperience":"My fishing experience in FFXIV is rooted in my time as a budding sprout wondering Eorzea clueless, na√Øve, and innocent. Fisher was my first Gathering class that I ever had interest in and picked up. Something about virtual fishing was so alluring to me, I found myself spending hours just fishing. It was a great escape from the monotony of the ARR story experience.\nI was intrigued and somewhat intimidated by the depth of fishing in FFXIV. This drew me in and before I knew it, I was hooked. I loved figuring out how to find the weather for areas and how to use different types of bait. This eventually lead me to discover the fishing voyages.\nOnce I knew fishing voyages existed in Limsa Lominsa Lower Decks, fishing became all the more intense. I started caring about my gear and my GP values, I started paying attention to baits and eventually came upon some incredibly useful tools to aid in my endeavor. I'm of course referring to Lulu's Tools, a tab which, to this day, I still have open. I fishing progress raided my way straight to 80 before I had even leveled a battle class to 80.

All the different varieties of bait can also be a bit annoying to get, but overall, the fish be pretty cool.\n\nSo yeah that is my ff14 fisher class. square enix should let us catch boots and other random garbage like you can in some fishing games, that would be neat. oh also they should add the Momora Mora to every zone.","notMiqote":true,"legend":0,"chocobo":"Kwehku. was playing twewy at the time and thought it was funny. it wasn't.","slimeRancher":"slime rancher pretty cool, played it once for ten minutes and was like \"hey i'll play this again\" and then never did but not in a bad sort of way, y'know?","gobbie":"As I live and Pshkohh...!","cow1":"brownSwiss","cow2":"jersey","cow3":"vosges","covid":"no","comments":"tetris is pretty cool, i like how the blocks fall and then get faster and then I lose because my opponent just dropped like five rows on me","balloons":true}
{"username":"Crathos Dragoon@Jenova (well any of them they're all probably me)","fishingExperience":"\tSo to set the scene, I'm a sprout fresh off the WoW boat (i haven't played since TBC but whatever that's not important), having freshly subbed to this game after being conned into it with promises of shiny endgame raids and catgirls (mostly catgirls). There's all these fun classes that i try out, i get dropped off at the rogue place, i can't get rogue because i'm not level 10, it's a big hassle, i contemplate quitting, yadda yadda, i only stay because of the catgirls dancing in limsa, you get the drill. Anyways at some point i mash my grubby mouse cursor on the character tab and discover a whole new set of classes before feasting my eyes on those words that shake me to the core: blacksmith. but also fishing looks cool so i learned it too.\n\tAt this point i'm like level 50 something and i get a pm from one of my friends that brought me into this grindy catgirl hellscape and he says more words that shake me to my core: \"Wanna go ocean fishing\"\n\"What the fuck is ocean fishing\" I say\n\"I don't know but it happens every two hours and apparently you have to be level 7 fishing\" he answers.\n\"when is every two hours\" i say, hoping he picks up the meaning from context as that's not exactly a full sentence but we all know what it meant\n\"in like 14 minutes\"\nat this point i'm like 'fuck it i have nothing better to do' so i go to bring out the old rod so i can catch clams or some shit and maybe catch the boat, but i can't find it.\n\"you probably vendored it\"\n\"where do i get a new one\"\n\"I don't know\"\nat this point i'm scrambling trying to get a rod, so i just buy one off marketboard (probably the same as the vendor one but for 1000x markup). I'm too lazy to write it out but basically just reread the paragraph up to this point except with bait instead.\n\tSo i finally hit level 7 (i'm not even sure if this is actually needed) and me and dipshit head to the docks so we can nab some sick ocean fish or some shit when i see her: this beautiful blue haired viera. \"what's up\" i say. \"not much\" she replies. And at that point i know i'm in. We get on the boat. I silently stand next to her, reeling in the fish. Somebody shouts which lure i need so i don't even have any excuse to bug her. it's fantastic. life is good, i'm having the time of my life. the boat docks. we get off without a word. i know we're destined to be together. a few months pass, i'm fishin out on the ocean with my ocean bois. i haven't seen her since, but i know she's still thinking about that time we fished together. But lo and behold, one day at the limsa markets, i see her. and she's /embracing this stupid red head catgirl (i dont know if i mentioned this yet but this isn't you its a different girl).

I took apprenticeship under a long time fisher known as Kali Reverend @ Faerie who has been around since GP struggle was a real thing back in HW (looking at you Opabinia). I finally during the 2-3 month struggle of COVID-19 hitting finished fishing and became a Grandmaster Caster at the beginning of April 2020.\n\nStethacanthus was my final catch, and in all honesty, Ruby didn't take me that long to snag. My \"white whale\" was definitely The Matriarch, with Sea Butterfly being a close second (though that's pretty common anyways). Overall, I know take new apprentices under my wing, and my pretty active on the Fishcord. I'm sad about the Fish Eye changes as new fishers will never experience the pain of HW fishing in full, and I'm looking forward to the new legends in 5.5.\n\nI am also a huge Ocean Fisher. Currently I am missing a single fish (blue of course, Placodus) and otherwise enjoy running for titles, though I prefer overworld fishing a lot more. I have also written my own fishing guide for new fishers with the new Fish eye changes included.","notMiqote":true,"legend":3,"chocobo":"Midgard","slimeRancher":"I have watched others play it, but haven't tried it myself.","gobbie":"gonna rise up, boom like thunder.","cow1":"moo","cow2":"moo","cow3":"moo","covid":"no","comments":"This was a fun questionnaire.

When I'm done with\nthe humans, they won't be able\n\n  \nto say, \"Honey, I'm home,\"\nwithout paying a royalty!\n\n  \nIt's an incredible scene\nhere in downtown Manhattan,\n\n  \nwhere the world anxiously waits,\nbecause for the first time in history,\n\n  \nwe will hear for ourselves\nif a honeybee can actually speak.\n\n  \nWhat have we gotten into here, Barry?\n\n  \nIt's pretty big, isn't it?\n\n  \nI can't believe how many humans\ndon't work during the day.\n\n  \nYou think billion-dollar multinational\nfood companies have good lawyers?\n\n  \nEverybody needs to stay\nbehind the barricade.\n\n  \n- What's the matter?\n- I don't know, I just got a chill.\n\n  \nWell, if it isn't the bee team.\n\n  \nYou boys work on this?\n\n  \nAll rise!

Yes, Your Honor,\nwe're ready to proceed.\n\n  \nMr. Montgomery,\nyour opening statement, please.\n\n  \nLadies and gentlemen of the jury,\n\n  \nmy grandmother was a simple woman.\n\n  \nBorn on a farm, she believed\nit was man's divine right\n\n  \nto benefit from the bounty\nof nature God put before us.\n\n  \nIf we lived in the topsy-turvy world\nMr. Benson imagines,\n\n  \njust think of what would it mean.\n\n  \nI would have to negotiate\nwith the silkworm\n\n  \nfor the elastic in my britches!\n\n  \nTalking bee!\n\n  \nHow do we know this isn't some sort of\n\n  \nholographic motion-picture-capture\nHollywood wizardry?\n\n  \nThey could be using laser beams!\n\n  \nRobotics! Ventriloquism!\nOloning! For all we know,\n\n  \nhe could be on steroids!\n\n  \nMr. Benson?\n\n  \nLadies and gentlemen,\nthere's no trickery here.\n\n  \nI'm just an ordinary bee.\nHoney's pretty important to me.\n\n  \nIt's important to all bees.\nWe invented it!\n\n  \nWe make it. And we protect it\nwith our lives.\n\n  \nUnfortunately, there are\nsome people in this room\n\n  \nwho think they can take it from us\n\n  \n'cause we're the little guys!\nI'm hoping that, after this is all over,\n\n  \nyou'll see how, by taking our honey,\nyou not only take everything we have\n\n  \nbut everything we are!\n\n  \nI wish he'd dress like that\nall the time. So nice!\n\n  \nOall your first witness.\n\n  \nSo, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden\nof Honey Farms, big company you have.\n\n  \nI suppose so.\n\n  \nI see you also own\nHoneyburton and Honron!\n\n  \nYes, they provide beekeepers\nfor our farms.\n\n  \nBeekeeper. I find that\nto be a very disturbing term.\n\n  \nI don't imagine you employ\nany bee-free-ers, do you?\n\n  \n- No.\n- I couldn't hear you.\n\n  \n- No.\n- No.\n\n  \nBecause you don't free bees.\nYou keep bees. Not only that,\n\n  \nit seems you thought a bear would be\nan appropriate image for a jar of honey.\n\n  \nThey're very lovable creatures.\n\n  \nYogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.\n\n  \nYou mean like this?\n\n  \nBears kill bees!\n\n  \nHow'd you like his head crashing\nthrough your living room?!\n\n  \nBiting into your couch!\nSpitting out your throw pillows!\n\n  \nOK, that's enough. Take him away.\n\n  \nSo, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.\nYour name intrigues me.\n\n  \n- Where have I heard it before?\n- I was with a band called The Police.\n\n  \nBut you've never been\na police officer, have you?\n\n  \nNo, I haven't.\n\n  \nNo, you haven't. And so here\nwe have yet another example\n\n  \nof bee culture casually\nstolen by a human\n\n  \nfor nothing more than\na prance-about stage name.\n\n  \nOh, please.\n\n  \nHave you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?\n\n  \nBecause I'm feeling\na little stung, Sting.\n\n  \nOr should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!\n\n  \nThat's not his real name?! You idiots!\n\n  \nMr. Liotta, first,\nbelated congratulations on\n\n  \nyour Emmy win for a guest spot\non ER in 2005.\n\n  \nThank you.

Is that a crime?\n\n  \nNot yet it isn't. But is this\nwhat it's come to for you?\n\n  \nExploiting tiny, helpless bees\nso you don't\n\n  \nhave to rehearse\nyour part and learn your lines, sir?\n\n  \nWatch it, Benson!\nI could blow right now!\n\n  \nThis isn't a goodfella.\nThis is a badfella!\n\n  \nWhy doesn't someone just step on\nthis creep, and we can all go home?!\n\n  \n- Order in this court!\n- You're all thinking it!\n\n  \nOrder! Order, I say!\n\n  \n- Say it!\n- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!\n\n  \nI think it was awfully nice\nof that bear to pitch in like that.\n\n  \nI think the jury's on our side.\n\n  \nAre we doing everything right, legally?\n\n  \nI'm a florist.\n\n  \nRight. Well, here's to a great team.\n\n  \nTo a great team!\n\n  \nWell, hello.\n\n  \n- Ken!\n- Hello.\n\n  \nI didn't think you were coming.\n\n  \nNo, I was just late.\nI tried to call, but... the battery.\n\n  \nI didn't want all this to go to waste,\nso I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.\n\n  \nOh, that was lucky.\n\n  \nThere's a little left.\nI could heat it up.\n\n  \nYeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.\n\n  \nSo I hear you're quite a tennis player.\n\n  \nI'm not much for the game myself.\nThe ball's a little grabby.\n\n  \nThat's where I usually sit.\nRight... there.\n\n  \nKen, Barry was looking at your resume,\n\n  \nand he agreed with me that eating with\nchopsticks isn't really a special skill.\n\n  \nYou think I don't see what you're doing?\n\n  \nI know how hard it is to find\nthe rightjob. We have that in common.\n\n  \nDo we?\n\n  \nBees have 100 percent employment,\nbut we do jobs like taking the crud out.\n\n  \nThat's just what\nI was thinking about doing.\n\n  \nKen, I let Barry borrow your razor\nfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.\n\n  \nI'm going to drain the old stinger.\n\n  \nYeah, you do that.\n\n  \nLook at that.\n\n  \nYou know, I've just about had it\n\n  \nwith your little mind games.\n\n  \n- What's that?\n- Italian Vogue.\n\n  \nMamma mia, that's a lot of pages.\n\n  \nA lot of ads.\n\n  \nRemember what Van said, why is\nyour life more valuable than mine?\n\n  \nFunny, I just can't seem to recall that!\n\n  \nI think something stinks in here!\n\n  \nI love the smell of flowers.\n\n  \nHow do you like the smell of flames?!\n\n  \nNot as much.\n\n  \nWater bug!

What are you talking about?!\nAre there other bugs in your life?\n\n  \nNo, but there are other things bugging\nme in life. And you're one of them!\n\n  \nFine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...\n\n  \nMy nerves are fried from riding\non this emotional roller coaster!\n\n  \nGoodbye, Ken.\n\n  \nAnd for your information,\n\n  \nI prefer sugar-free, artificial\nsweeteners made by man!\n\n  \nI'm sorry about all that.\n\n  \nI know it's got\nan aftertaste! I like it!\n\n  \nI always felt there was some kind\nof barrier between Ken and me.\n\n  \nI couldn't overcome it.\nOh, well.\n\n  \nAre you OK for the trial?\n\n  \nI believe Mr. Montgomery\nis about out of ideas.\n\n  \nWe would like to call\nMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.\n\n  \nGood idea! You can really see why he's\nconsidered one of the best lawyers...\n\n  \nYeah.\n\n  \nLayton, you've\ngotta weave some magic\n\n  \nwith this jury,\nor it's gonna be all over.\n\n  \nDon't worry. The only thing I have\nto do to turn this jury around\n\n  \nis to remind them\nof what they don't like about bees.\n\n  \n- You got the tweezers?\n- Are you allergic?\n\n  \nOnly to losing, son. Only to losing.\n\n  \nMr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you\nwhat I think we'd all like to know.\n\n  \nWhat exactly is your relationship\n\n  \nto that woman?\n\n  \nWe're friends.\n\n  \n- Good friends?\n- Yes.\n\n  \nHow good? Do you live together?\n\n  \nWait a minute...\n\n  \nAre you her little...\n\n  \n...bedbug?\n\n  \nI've seen a bee documentary or two.\nFrom what I understand,\n\n  \ndoesn't your queen give birth\nto all the bee children?\n\n  \n- Yeah, but...\n- So those aren't your real parents!\n\n  \n- Oh, Barry...\n- Yes, they are!\n\n  \nHold me back!\n\n  \nYou're an illegitimate bee,\naren't you, Benson?\n\n  \nHe's denouncing bees!\n\n  \nDon't y'all date your cousins?\n\n  \n- Objection!\n- I'm going to pincushion this guy!\n\n  \nAdam, don't! It's what he wants!\n\n  \nOh, I'm hit!!\n\n  \nOh, lordy, I am hit!\n\n  \nOrder! Order!\n\n  \nThe venom! The venom\nis coursing through my veins!\n\n  \nI have been felled\nby a winged beast of destruction!\n\n  \nYou see? You can't treat them\nlike equals! They're striped savages!\n\n  \nStinging's the only thing\nthey know! It's their way!\n\n  \n- Adam, stay with me.\n- I can't feel my legs.\n\n  \nWhat angel of mercy\nwill come forward to suck the poison\n\n  \nfrom my heaving buttocks?\n\n  \nI will have order in this court. Order!\n\n  \nOrder, please!\n\n  \nThe case of the honeybees\nversus the human race\n\n  \ntook a pointed turn against the bees\n\n  \nyesterday when one of their legal\nteam stung Layton T. Montgomery.\n\n  \n- Hey, buddy.\n- Hey.\n\n  \n- Is there much pain?\n- Yeah.\n\n  \nI...\n\n  \nI blew the whole case, didn't I?\n\n  \nIt doesn't matter. What matters is\nyou're alive. You could have died.\n\n  \nI'd be better off dead. Look at me.\n\n  \nThey got it from the cafeteria\ndownstairs, in a tuna sandwich.\n\n  \nLook, there's\na little celery still on it.\n\n  \nWhat was it like to sting someone?\n\n  \nI can't explain it. It was all...\n\n  \nAll adrenaline and then...\nand then ecstasy!\n\n  \nAll right.\n\n  \nYou think it was all a trap?\n\n  \nOf course. I'm sorry.\nI flew us right into this.\n\n  \nWhat were we thinking? Look at us. We're\njust a couple of bugs in this world.\n\n  \nWhat will the humans do to us\nif they win?\n\n  \nI don't know.\n\n  \nI hear they put the roaches in motels.\nThat doesn't sound so bad.\n\n  \nAdam, they check in,\nbut they don't check out!\n\n  \nOh, my.\n\n  \nOould you get a nurse\nto close that window?\n\n  \n- Why?\n- The smoke.\n\n  \nBees don't smoke.\n\n  \nRight. Bees don't smoke.\n\n  \nBees don't smoke!\nBut some bees are smoking.\n\n  \nThat's it! That's our case!\n\n  \nIt is? It's not over?\n\n  \nGet dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.\n\n  \nGet back to the court and stall.\nStall any way you can.\n\n  \nAnd assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.\n\n  \nMr. Flayman.\n\n  \nYes? Yes, Your Honor!\n\n  \nWhere is the rest of your team?\n\n  \nWell, Your Honor, it's interesting.\n\n  \nBees are trained to fly haphazardly,\n\n  \nand as a result,\nwe don't make very good time.\n\n  \nI actually heard a funny story about...\n\n  \nYour Honor,\nhaven't these ridiculous bugs\n\n  \ntaken up enough\nof this court's valuable time?\n\n  \nHow much longer will we allow\nthese absurd shenanigans to go on?\n\n  \nThey have presented no compelling\nevidence to support their charges\n\n  \nagainst my clients,\nwho run legitimate businesses.\n\n  \nI move for a complete dismissal\nof this entire case!\n\n  \nMr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going\n\n  \nto have to consider\nMr. Montgomery's motion.\n\n  \nBut you can't! We have a terrific case.\n\n  \nWhere is your proof?\nWhere is the evidence?\n\n  \nShow me the smoking gun!\n\n  \nHold it, Your Honor!\nYou want a smoking gun?\n\n  \nHere is your smoking gun.\n\n  \nWhat is that?\n\n  \nIt's a bee smoker!\n\n  \nWhat, this?\nThis harmless little contraption?\n\n  \nThis couldn't hurt a fly,\nlet alone a bee.\n\n  \nLook at what has happened\n\n  \nto bees who have never been asked,\n\"Smoking or non?\"\n\n  \nIs this what nature intended for us?\n\n  \nTo be forcibly addicted\nto smoke machines\n\n  \nand man-made wooden slat work camps?\n\n  \nLiving out our lives as honey slaves\nto the white man?\n\n  \n- What are we gonna do?\n- He's playing the species card.\n\n  \nLadies and gentlemen, please,\nfree these bees!\n\n  \nFree the bees! Free the bees!\n\n  \nFree the bees!\n\n  \nFree the bees! Free the bees!\n\n  \nThe court finds in favor of the bees!\n\n  \nVanessa, we won!\n\n  \nI knew you could do it! High-five!\n\n  \nSorry.\n\n  \nI'm OK! You know what this means?\n\n  \nAll the honey\nwill finally belong to the bees.\n\n  \nNow we won't have\nto work so hard all the time.\n\n  \nThis is an unholy perversion\nof the balance of nature, Benson.\n\n  \nYou'll regret this.\n\n  \nBarry, how much honey is out there?\n\n  \nAll right. One at a time.\n\n  \nBarry, who are you wearing?\n\n  \nMy sweater is Ralph Lauren,\nand I have no pants.\n\n  \n- What if Montgomery's right?\n- What do you mean?\n\n  \nWe've been living the bee way\na long time, 27 million years.\n\n  \nOongratulations on your victory.\nWhat will you demand as a settlement?\n\n  \nFirst, we'll demand a complete shutdown\nof all bee work camps.\n\n  \nThen we want back the honey\nthat was ours to begin with,\n\n  \nevery last drop.\n\n  \nWe demand an end to the glorification\nof the bear as anything more\n\n  \nthan a filthy, smelly,\nbad-breath stink machine.\n\n  \nWe're all aware\nof what they do in the woods.\n\n  \nWait for my signal.\n\n  \nTake him out.\n\n  \nHe'll have nauseous\nfor a few hours, then he'll be fine.\n\n  \nAnd we will no longer tolerate\nbee-negative nicknames...\n\n  \nBut it's just a prance-about stage name!\n\n  \n...unnecessary inclusion of honey\nin bogus health products\n\n  \nand la-dee-da human\ntea-time snack garnishments.\n\n  \nOan't breathe.\n\n  \nBring it in, boys!\n\n  \nHold it right there! Good.\n\n  \nTap it.\n\n  \nMr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,\nand there's gallons more coming!\n\n  \n- I think we need to shut down!\n- Shut down? We've never shut down.\n\n  \nShut down honey production!\n\n  \nStop making honey!\n\n  \nTurn your key, sir!\n\n  \nWhat do we do now?\n\n  \nOannonball!\n\n  \nWe're shutting honey production!\n\n  \nMission abort.\n\n  \nAborting pollination and nectar detail.\nReturning to base.\n\n  \nAdam, you wouldn't believe\nhow much honey was out there.\n\n  \nOh, yeah?\n\n  \nWhat's going on? Where is everybody?\n\n  \n- Are they out celebrating?\n- They're home.\n\n  \nThey don't know what to do.\nLaying out, sleeping in.\n\n  \nI heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way\nto San Antonio with a cricket.\n\n  \nAt least we got our honey back.\n\n  \nSometimes I think, so what if humans\nliked our honey? Who wouldn't?\n\n  \nIt's the greatest thing in the world!\nI was excited to be part of making it.\n\n  \nThis was my new desk. This was my\nnew job. I wanted to do it really well.\n\n  \nAnd now...\n\n  \nNow I can't.\n\n  \nI don't understand\nwhy they're not happy.\n\n  \nI thought their lives would be better!\n\n  \nThey're doing nothing. It's amazing.\nHoney really changes people.\n\n  \nYou don't have any idea\nwhat's going on, do you?\n\n  \n- What did you want to show me?\n- This.\n\n  \nWhat happened here?\n\n  \nThat is not the half of it.\n\n  \nOh, no. Oh, my.\n\n  \nThey're all wilting.\n\n  \nDoesn't look very good, does it?\n\n  \nNo.\n\n  \nAnd whose fault do you think that is?\n\n  \nYou know, I'm gonna guess bees.\n\n  \nBees?\n\n  \nSpecifically, me.\n\n  \nI didn't think bees not needing to make\nhoney would affect all these things.\n\n  \nIt's notjust flowers.\nFruits, vegetables, they all need bees.\n\n  \nThat's our whole SAT test right there.\n\n  \nTake away produce, that affects\nthe entire animal kingdom.\n\n  \nAnd then, of course...\n\n  \nThe human species?\n\n  \nSo if there's no more pollination,\n\n  \nit could all just go south here,\ncouldn't it?\n\n  \nI know this is also partly my fault.\n\n  \nHow about a suicide pact?\n\n  \nHow do we do it?\n\n  \n- I'll sting you, you step on me.\n- Thatjust kills you twice.\n\n  \nRight, right.\n\n  \nListen, Barry...\nsorry, but I gotta get going.\n\n  \nI had to open my mouth and talk.\n\n  \nVanessa?\n\n  \nVanessa? Why are you leaving?\nWhere are you going?\n\n  \nTo the final Tournament of Roses parade\nin Pasadena.\n\n  \nThey've moved it to this weekend\nbecause all the flowers are dying.\n\n  \nIt's the last chance\nI'll ever have to see it.\n\n  \nVanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.\nI never meant it to turn out like this.\n\n  \nI know. Me neither.\n\n  \nTournament of Roses.\nRoses can't do sports.\n\n  \nWait a minute. Roses. Roses?\n\n  \nRoses!\n\n  \nVanessa!\n\n  \nRoses?!\n\n  \nBarry?\n\n  \n- Roses are flowers!\n- Yes, they are.\n\n  \nFlowers, bees, pollen!\n\n  \nI know.\nThat's why this is the last parade.\n\n  \nMaybe not.\nOould you ask him to slow down?\n\n  \nOould you slow down?\n\n  \nBarry!\n\n  \nOK, I made a huge mistake.\nThis is a total disaster, all my fault.\n\n  \nYes, it kind of is.\n\n  \nI've ruined the planet.\nI wanted to help you\n\n  \nwith the flower shop.\nI've made it worse.\n\n  \nActually, it's completely closed down.\n\n  \nI thought maybe you were remodeling.\n\n  \nBut I have another idea, and it's\ngreater than my previous ideas combined.\n\n  \nI don't want to hear it!\n\n  \nAll right, they have the roses,\nthe roses have the pollen.\n\n  \nI know every bee, plant\nand flower bud in this park.\n\n  \nAll we gotta do is get what they've got\nback here with what we've got.\n\n  \n- Bees.\n- Park.\n\n  \n- Pollen!\n- Flowers.\n\n  \n- Repollination!\n- Across the nation!\n\n  \nTournament of Roses,\nPasadena, Oalifornia.\n\n  \nThey've got nothing\nbut flowers, floats and cotton candy.\n\n  \nSecurity will be tight.\n\n  \nI have an idea.\n\n  \nVanessa Bloome, FTD.\n\n  \nOfficial floral business. It's real.\n\n  \nSorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.\n\n  \nThank you. It was a gift.\n\n  \nOnce inside,\nwe just pick the right float.\n\n  \nHow about The Princess and the Pea?\n\n  \nI could be the princess,\nand you could be the pea!\n\n  \nYes, I got it.\n\n  \n- Where should I sit?\n- What are you?\n\n  \n- I believe I'm the pea.\n- The pea?\n\n  \nIt goes under the mattresses.\n\n  \n- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.\n- I'm getting the marshal.\n\n  \nYou do that!\nThis whole parade is a fiasco!\n\n  \nLet's see what this baby'll do.\n\n  \nHey, what are you doing?!\n\n  \nThen all we do\nis blend in with traffic...\n\n  \n...without arousing suspicion.\n\n  \nOnce at the airport,\nthere's no stopping us.\n\n  \nStop! Security.\n\n  \n- You and your insect pack your float?\n- Yes.\n\n  \nHas it been\nin your possession the entire time?\n\n  \nWould you remove your shoes?\n\n  \n- Remove your stinger.\n- It's part of me.\n\n  \nI know. Just having some fun.\nEnjoy your flight.\n\n  \nThen if we're lucky, we'll have\njust enough pollen to do the job.\n\n  \nOan you believe how lucky we are? We\nhave just enough pollen to do the job!\n\n  \nI think this is gonna work.\n\n  \nIt's got to work.\n\n  \nAttention, passengers,\nthis is Oaptain Scott.\n\n  \nWe have a bit of bad weather\nin New York.\n\n  \nIt looks like we'll experience\na couple hours delay.\n\n  \nBarry, these are cut flowers\nwith no water. They'll never make it.\n\n  \nI gotta get up there\nand talk to them.\n\n  \nBe careful.\n\n  \nOan I get help\nwith the Sky Mall magazine?\n\n  \nI'd like to order the talking\ninflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.\n\n  \nOaptain, I'm in a real situation.\n\n  \n- What'd you say, Hal?\n- Nothing.\n\n  \nBee!\n\n  \nDon't freak out! My entire species...\n\n  \nWhat are you doing?\n\n  \n- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!\n- Who's an attorney?\n\n  \nDon't move.\n\n  \nOh, Barry.\n\n  \nGood afternoon, passengers.\nThis is your captain.\n\n  \nWould a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B\nplease report to the cockpit?\n\n  \nAnd please hurry!\n\n  \nWhat happened here?\n\n  \nThere was a DustBuster,\na toupee, a life raft exploded.\n\n  \nOne's bald, one's in a boat,\nthey're both unconscious!\n\n  \n- Is that another bee joke?\n- No!\n\n  \nNo one's flying the plane!\n\n  \nThis is JFK control tower, Flight 356.\nWhat's your status?\n\n  \nThis is Vanessa Bloome.\nI'm a florist from New York.\n\n  \nWhere's the pilot?\n\n  \nHe's unconscious,\nand so is the copilot.\n\n  \nNot good. Does anyone onboard\nhave flight experience?\n\n  \nAs a matter of fact, there is.\n\n  \n- Who's that?\n- Barry Benson.\n\n  \nFrom the honey trial?! Oh, great.\n\n  \nVanessa, this is nothing more\nthan a big metal bee.\n\n  \nIt's got giant wings, huge engines.\n\n  \nI can't fly a plane.\n\n  \n- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?\n- Yes.\n\n  \nHow hard could it be?\n\n  \nWait, Barry!\nWe're headed into some lightning.\n\n  \nThis is Bob Bumble. We have some\nlate-breaking news from JFK Airport,\n\n  \nwhere a suspenseful scene\nis developing.\n\n  \nBarry Benson,\nfresh from his legal victory...\n\n  \nThat's Barry!\n\n  \n...is attempting to land a plane,\nloaded with people, flowers\n\n  \nand an incapacitated flight crew.\n\n  \nFlowers?!\n\n  \nWe have a storm in the area\nand two individuals at the controls\n\n  \nwith absolutely no flight experience.\n\n  \nJust a minute.\nThere's a bee on that plane.\n\n  \nI'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson\nand his no-account compadres.\n\n  \nThey've done enough damage.\n\n  \nBut isn't he your only hope?\n\n  \nTechnically, a bee\nshouldn't be able to fly at all.\n\n  \nTheir wings are too small...\n\n  \nHaven't we heard this a million times?\n\n  \n\"The surface area of the wings\nand body mass make no sense.\"\n\n  \n- Get this on the air!\n- Got it.\n\n  \n- Stand by.\n- We're going live.\n\n  \nThe way we work may be a mystery to you.\n\n  \nMaking honey takes a lot of bees\ndoing a lot of small jobs.\n\n  \nBut let me tell you about a small job.\n\n  \nIf you do it well,\nit makes a big difference.\n\n  \nMore than we realized.\nTo us, to everyone.\n\n  \nThat's why I want to get bees\nback to working together.\n\n  \nThat's the bee way!\nWe're not made of Jell-O.\n\n  \nWe get behind a fellow.\n\n  \n- Black and yellow!\n- Hello!\n\n  \nLeft, right, down, hover.\n\n  \n- Hover?\n- Forget hover.\n\n  \nThis isn't so hard.\nBeep-beep! Beep-beep!\n\n  \nBarry, what happened?!\n\n  \nWait, I think we were\non autopilot the whole time.\n\n  \n- That may have been helping me.\n- And now we're not!\n\n  \nSo it turns out I cannot fly a plane.\n\n  \nAll of you, let's get\nbehind this fellow! Move it out!\n\n  \nMove out!\n\n  \nOur only chance is if I do what I'd do,\nyou copy me with the wings of the plane!\n\n  \nDon't have to yell.\n\n  \nI'm not yelling!\nWe're in a lot of trouble.\n\n  \nIt's very hard to concentrate\nwith that panicky tone in your voice!\n\n  \nIt's not a tone. I'm panicking!\n\n  \nI can't do this!\n\n  \nVanessa, pull yourself together.\nYou have to snap out of it!\n\n  \nYou snap out of it.\n\n  \nYou snap out of it.\n\n  \n- You snap out of it!\n- You snap out of it!\n\n  \n- You snap out of it!\n- You snap out of it!\n\n  \n- You snap out of it!\n- You snap out of it!\n\n  \n- Hold it!\n- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.\n\n  \nHow is the plane flying?\n\n  \nI don't know.\n\n  \nHello?\n\n  \nBenson, got any flowers\nfor a happy occasion in there?\n\n  \nThe Pollen Jocks!\n\n  \nThey do get behind a fellow.\n\n  \n- Black and yellow.\n- Hello.\n\n  \nAll right, let's drop this tin can\non the blacktop.\n\n  \nWhere? I can't see anything. Oan you?\n\n  \nNo, nothing. It's all cloudy.\n\n  \nOome on. You got to think bee, Barry.\n\n  \n- Thinking bee.\n- Thinking bee.\n\n  \nThinking bee!\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\n\n  \nWait a minute.\nI think I'm feeling something.\n\n  \n- What?\n- I don't know.

Don't be afraid.\nSmell it. Full reverse!\n\n  \nJust drop it. Be a part of it.\n\n  \nAim for the center!\n\n  \nNow drop it in!

{"username":"Saris Midgar","fishingExperience":"Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are often caught in the wild but may also be caught from stocked bodies of water. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. ‚ÄúFishing‚Äù may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not normally applied to catching farmed fish, or to aquatic mammals, such as whales where the term whaling is more appropriate. In addition to being caught to be eaten, fish are caught as recreational pastimes. Fishing tournaments are held, and caught fish are sometimes kept as preserved or living trophies. When bioblitzes occur, fish are typically caught, identified, and then released.\n\nAccording to the United Nations FAO statistics, the total number of commercial fishers and fish farmers is estimated to be 38 million. Fisheries and aquaculture provide direct and indirect employment to over 500 million people in developing countries.[1] In 2005, the worldwide per capita consumption of fish captured from wild fisheries was 14.4 kilograms, with an additional 7.4 kilograms harvested from fish farms.[2]ishing is an ancient practice that dates back to at least the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic period about 40,000 years ago.[3] Isotopic analysis of the remains of Tianyuan man, a 40,000-year-old modern human from eastern Asia, has shown that he regularly consumed freshwater fish.[4][5] Archaeology features such as shell middens,[6] discarded fish bones, and cave paintings show that sea foods were important for survival and consumed in significant quantities. Fishing in Africa is evident very early on in human history. Neanderthals were fishing by about 200,000 BC.[7] People could have developed basketry for fish traps, and spinning and early forms of knitting in order to make fishing nets[8] to be able to catch more fish in larger quantities.\n\nDuring this period, most people lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and were, of necessity, constantly on the move. However, where there are early examples of permanent settlements (though not necessarily permanently occupied) such as those at Lepenski Vir, they are almost always associated with fishing as a major source of food.\n\nTrawling\nThe British dogger was an early type of sailing trawler from the 17th century, but the modern fishing trawler was developed in the 19th century, at the English fishing port of Brixham. By the early 19th century, the fishers at Brixham needed to expand their fishing area further than ever before due to the ongoing depletion of stocks that was occurring in the overfished waters of South Devon. The Brixham trawler that evolved there was of a sleek build and had a tall gaff rig, which gave the vessel sufficient speed to make long-distance trips out to the fishing grounds in the ocean. They were also sufficiently robust to be able to tow large trawls in deep water. The great trawling fleet that built up at Brixham, earned the village the title of 'Mother of Deep-Sea Fisheries'.[9]\n\n\nPainting of A Brixham trawler by William Adolphus Knell. The painting is now in the National Maritime Museum.\nThis revolutionary design made large scale trawling in the ocean possible for the first time, resulting in a massive migration of fishers from the ports in the South of England, to villages further north, such as Scarborough, Hull, Grimsby, Harwich and Yarmouth, that were points of access to the large fishing grounds in the Atlantic Ocean.[9]\n\nThe small village of Grimsby grew to become the largest fishing port in the world[10][dead link] by the mid 19th century. An Act of Parliament was first obtained in 1796, which authorised the construction of new quays and dredging of the Haven to make it deeper.[11] It was only in 1846, with the tremendous expansion in the fishing industry, that the Grimsby Dock Company was formed. The foundation stone for the Royal Dock was laid by Albert the Prince consort in 1849. The dock covered 25 acres (10 ha) and was formally opened by Queen Victoria in 1854 as the first modern fishing port.\n\nThe elegant Brixham trawler spread across the world, influencing fishing fleets everywhere.[12] By the end of the 19th century, there were over 3,000 fishing trawlers in commission in Britain, with almost 1,000 at Grimsby. These trawlers were sold to fishers around Europe, including from the Netherlands and Scandinavia. Twelve trawlers went on to form the nucleus of the German fishing fleet.[13]\n\nThe earliest steam-powered fishing boats first appeared in the 1870s and used the trawl system of fishing as well as lines and drift nets. These were large boats, usually 80‚Äì90 feet (24‚Äì27 m) in length with a beam of around 20 feet (6.1 m). They weighed 40‚Äì50 tons and travelled at 9‚Äì11 knots (17‚Äì20 km/h; 10‚Äì13 mph). The earliest purpose-built fishing vessels were designed and made by David Allan in Leith, Scotland in March 1875, when he converted a drifter to steam power. In 1877, he built the first screw propelled steam trawler in the world.[14]\n\nSteam trawlers were introduced at Grimsby and Hull in the 1880s. In 1890 it was estimated that there were 20,000 men on the North Sea. The steam drifter was not used in the herring fishery until 1897. The last sailing fishing trawler was built in 1925 in Grimsby. Trawler designs adapted as the way they were powered changed from sail to coal-fired steam by World War I to diesel and turbines by the end of World War II.\n\nIn 1931, the first powered drum was created by Laurie Jarelainen. The drum was a circular device that was set to the side of the boat and would draw in the nets. Since World War II, radio navigation aids and fish finders have been widely used. The first trawlers fished over the side, rather than over the stern. The first purpose-built stern trawler was Fairtry built-in 1953 at Aberdeen, Scotland. The ship was much larger than any other trawlers then in operation and inaugurated the era of the 'super trawler'. As the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it could lift out a much greater haul of up to 60 tons.[15] The ship served as a basis for the expansion of 'super trawlers' around the world in the following decades.[15]\n\nRecreational fishing\nMain article: Recreational fishing\n\nIzaak Walton's Compleat Angler, published in 1653 helped popularise fly fishing as a sport.\nWoodcut by Louis Rhead\nThe early evolution of fishing as recreation is not clear. For example, there is anecdotal evidence for fly fishing in Japan, however, fly fishing was likely to have been a means of survival, rather than recreation. The earliest English essay on recreational fishing was published in 1496, by Dame Juliana Berners, the prioress of the Benedictine Sopwell Nunnery. The essay was titled Treatyse of Fysshynge wyth an Angle,[16] and included detailed information on fishing waters, the construction of rods and lines, and the use of natural baits and artificial flies.[17]\n\nRecreational fishing took a great leap forward after the English Civil War, where a newly found interest in the activity left its mark on the many books and treatises that were written on the subject at the time. Leonard Mascall in 1589 wrote A booke of Fishing with Hooke and Line along with many others he produced in his life on game and wildlife in England at the time. The Compleat Angler was written by Izaak Walton in 1653 (although Walton continued to add to it for a quarter of a century) and described the fishing in the Derbyshire Wye. It was a celebration of the art and spirit of fishing in prose and verse. A second part to the book was added by Walton's friend Charles Cotton.[18]\n\nCharles Kirby designed an improved fishing hook in 1655 that remains relatively unchanged to this day. He went on to invent the Kirby bend, a distinctive hook with an offset point, still commonly used today.[19]\n\n\nTrading card of the Ustonson company, an early firm specializing in fishing equipment, and holder of a Royal Warrant from the 1760s.\nThe 18th century was mainly an era of consolidation of the techniques developed in the previous century. Running rings began to appear along the fishing rods, which gave anglers greater control over the cast line. The rods themselves were also becoming increasingly sophisticated and specialised for different roles. Jointed rods became common from the middle of the century and bamboo came to be used for the top section of the rod, giving it a much greater strength and flexibility.\n\nThe industry also became commercialised ‚Äì rods and tackle were sold at the haberdashers store. After the Great Fire of London in 1666, artisans moved to Redditch which became a centre of production of fishing related products from the 1730s. Onesimus Ustonson established his shop in 1761, and his establishment remained as a market leader for the next century. He received a Royal Warrant from three successive monarchs starting with King George IV.[20] He also invented the multiplying winch. The commercialization of the industry came at a time of expanded interest in fishing as a recreational hobby for members of the aristocracy.[21]\n\nThe impact of the Industrial Revolution was first felt in the manufacture of fly lines. Instead of anglers twisting their lines ‚Äì a laborious and time-consuming process ‚Äì the new textile spinning machines allowed for a variety of tapered lines to be easily manufactured and marketed.\n\nBritish fly-fishing continued to develop in the 19th Century, with the emergence of fly fishing clubs, along with the appearance of several books on the subject of fly tying and fly fishing techniques.\n\nBy the mid to late 19th century, expanding leisure opportunities for the middle and lower classes began to have its effect on fly fishing, which steadily grew in mass appeal. The expansion of the railway network in Britain allowed the less affluent for the first time to take weekend trips to the seaside or rivers for fishing. Richer hobbyists ventured further abroad.[22] The large rivers of Norway replete with large stocks of salmon began to attract fishers from England in large numbers in the middle of the century ‚Äì Jones's guide to Norway, and salmon-fisher's pocket companion, published in 1848, was written by Frederic Tolfrey and was a popular guide to the country.[22]\n\n\n'Nottingham' and 'Scarborough' reel designs.\nModern reel design had begun in England during the latter part of the 18th century, and the predominant model in use was known as the 'Nottingham reel'. The reel was a wide drum that spooled out freely and was ideal for allowing the bait to drift along way out with the current. Geared multiplying reels never successfully caught on in Britain, but had more success in the United States, where similar models were modified by George Snyder of Kentucky into his bait-casting reel, the first American-made design in 1810.[23]\n\nThe material used for the rod itself changed from the heavy woods native to England to lighter and more elastic varieties imported from abroad, especially from South America and the West Indies. Bamboo rods became the generally favoured option from the mid 19th century, and several strips of the material were cut from the cane, milled into shape, and then glued together to form the light, strong, hexagonal rods with a solid core that were superior to anything that preceded them. George Cotton and his predecessors fished their flies with long rods, and light lines allowing the wind to do most of the work of getting the fly to the fish. [24]\n\n\nFishing became a popular recreational activity in the 19th century. Print from Currier and Ives.\nTackle design began to improve from the 1880s. The introduction of new woods to the manufacture of fly rods made it possible to cast flies into the wind on silk lines, instead of horse hair. These lines allowed for a much greater casting distance. However, these early fly lines proved troublesome as they had to be coated with various dressings to make them float and needed to be taken off the reel and dried every four hours or so to prevent them from becoming waterlogged. Another negative consequence was that it became easy for the much longer line to get into a tangle ‚Äì this was called a 'tangle' in Britain, and a 'backlash' in the US. This problem spurred the invention of the regulator to evenly spool the line out and prevent tangling.[24]\n\nThe American, Charles F. Orvis, designed and distributed a novel reel and fly design in 1874, described by reel historian Jim Brown as the \"benchmark of American reel design,\" and the first fully modern fly reel.[25][26]\n\nAlbert Illingworth, 1st Baron Illingworth a textiles magnate, patented the modern form of fixed-spool spinning reel in 1905. When casting Illingworth's reel design, the line was drawn off the leading edge of the spool but was restrained and rewound by a line pickup, a device which orbits around the stationary spool. Because the line did not have to pull against a rotating spool, much lighter lures could be cast than with conventional reels.[24]\n\nThe development of inexpensive fiberglass rods, synthetic fly lines, and monofilament leaders in the early 1950s, that revived the popularity of fly fishing.\n\nTechniques\n\nFishermen with traditional fish traps, Vietnam\nMain article: Fishing techniques\nThere are many fishing techniques and tactics for catching fish. The term can also be applied to methods for catching other aquatic animals such as molluscs (shellfish, squid, octopus) and edible marine invertebrates.\n\nFishing techniques include hand gathering, spearfishing, netting, angling and trapping. Recreational, commercial and artisanal fishers use different techniques, and also, sometimes, the same techniques. Recreational fishers fish for pleasure, sport, or to provide food for themselves, while commercial fishers fish for profit. Artisanal fishers use traditional, low-tech methods, for survival in third-world countries, and as a cultural heritage in other countries. Usually, recreational fishers use angling methods and commercial fishers use netting methods. A modern development is to fish with the assistance of a drone.[27]\n\nWhy a fish bites a baited hook or lure involves several factors related to the sensory physiology, behaviour, feeding ecology, and biology of the fish as well as the environment and characteristics of the bait/hook/lure.[28] There is an intricate link between various fishing techniques and knowledge about the fish and their behaviour including migration, foraging and habitat. The effective use of fishing techniques often depends on this additional knowledge.[29] Some fishers follow fishing folklores which claim that fish feeding patterns are influenced by the position of the sun and the moon.\n\nTackle\nMan seated at the side of the water surrounded by fishing rods and tackle.\nAn angler on the Kennet and Avon Canal, England, with his tackle\nMain article: Fishing tackle\nFishing tackle is the equipment used by fishers when fishing. Almost any equipment or gear used for fishing can be called fishing tackle. Some examples are hooks, lines, sinkers, floats, rods, reels, baits, lures, spears, nets, gaffs, traps, waders and tackle boxes.\n\nTackle that is attached to the end of a fishing line is called terminal tackle. This includes hooks, sinkers, floats, leaders, swivels, split rings and wire, snaps, beads, spoons, blades, spinners and clevises to attach spinner blades to fishing lures. People also tend to use dead or live fish as another form of bait.\n\nFishing tackle refers to the physical equipment that is used when fishing, whereas fishing techniques refers to the ways the tackle is used when fishing.\n\nFishing vessels\n\nCommercial crab boat working in the North Sea\n\nSmall sport fishing boat\nSee also: Fishing vessels and Traditional fishing boats\nA fishing vessel is a boat or ship used to catch fish in the sea, or on a lake or river. Many different kinds of vessels are used in commercial, artisanal and recreational fishing.\n\nAccording to the FAO, in 2004 there were four million commercial fishing vessels.[30] About 1.3 million of these are decked vessels with enclosed areas. Nearly all of these decked vessels are mechanised, and 40,000 of them are over 100 tons. At the other extreme, two-thirds (1.8 million) of the undecked boats are traditional craft of various types, powered only by sail and oars.[30] These boats are used by artisan fishers.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how many recreational fishing boats there are, although the number is high. The term is fluid since some recreational boats may also be used for fishing from time to time. Unlike most commercial fishing vessels, recreational fishing boats are often not dedicated just to fishing. Just about anything that will stay afloat can be called a recreational fishing boat, so long as a fisher periodically climbs aboard with the intent to catch a fish. Fish are caught for recreational purposes from boats which range from dugout canoes, float tubes, kayaks, rafts, stand up paddleboards, pontoon boats and small dinghies to runabouts, cabin cruisers and cruising yachts to large, hi-tech and luxurious big game rigs.[31] Larger boats, purpose-built with recreational fishing in mind, usually have large, open cockpits at the stern, designed for convenient fishing.\n\nTraditional fishing\nMain article: Artisan fishing\nTraditional fishing is any kind of small scale, commercial or subsistence fishing practices using traditional techniques such as rod and tackle, arrows and harpoons, throw nets and drag nets, etc.\n\nRecreational fishing\n\nAngling\nMain article: Recreational fishing\nRecreational and sport fishing are fishing primarily for pleasure or competition. Recreational fishing has conventions, rules, licensing restrictions and laws that limit how fish may be caught; typically, these prohibit the use of nets and the catching of fish with hooks not in the mouth. The most common form of recreational fishing is done with a rod, reel, line, hooks and any one of a wide range of baits or lures such as artificial flies. The practice of catching or attempting to catch fish with a hook is generally known as angling. In angling, it is sometimes expected or required that fish be returned to the water (catch and release). Recreational or sport fishermen may log their catches or participate in fishing competitions.\n\nThe estimated global number of recreational fishers varies from 220 million to a maximum number of 700 million fishers globally,[32] which is thought to be double the amount of individuals working as commercial fishers. In the United States alone it was estimated that 50.1 million people engaged in fishing activities in both saltwater and freshwater environments. [33]\n\nBig-game fishing is fishing from boats to catch large open-water species such as tuna, sharks, and marlin. Sportfishing (sometimes game fishing) is recreational fishing where the primary reward is the challenge of finding and catching the fish rather than the culinary or financial value of the fish's flesh. Fish sought after include tarpon, sailfish, mackerel and many others.\n\nFishing industry\nMain article: Fishing industry\n\nContribution of fish to animal protein supply, average 2013-2015\n\n \n\nWorld capture fisheries and aquaculture production 1950 - 2015\n\n\nModern Spanish tuna purse seiner in the Seychelles Islands.\nThe fishing industry includes any industry or activity concerned with taking, culturing, processing, preserving, storing, transporting, marketing or selling fish or fish products. It is defined by the FAO as including recreational, subsistence and commercial fishing, and the harvesting, processing, and marketing sectors.[34] The commercial activity is aimed at the delivery of fish and other seafood products for human consumption or use as raw material in other industrial processes.\n\nThere are three principal industry sectors:[note 1]\n\nThe commercial sector comprises enterprises and individuals associated with wild-catch or aquaculture resources and the various transformations of those resources into products for sale.\nThe traditional sector comprises enterprises and individuals associated with fisheries resources from which aboriginal people derive products following their traditions.\nThe recreational sector comprises enterprises and individuals associated with the purpose of recreation, sport or sustenance with fisheries resources from which products are derived that are not for sale.\nCommercial fishing\nMain article: Commercial fishing\n\nFishing boat in a heavy sea\nCommercial fishing is the capture of fish for commercial purposes. Those who practice it must often pursue fish far from the land under adverse conditions. Commercial fishermen harvest almost all aquatic species, from tuna, cod and salmon to shrimp, krill, lobster, clams, squid and crab, in various fisheries for these species. Commercial fishing methods have become very efficient using large nets and sea-going processing factories. Individual fishing quotas and international treaties seek to control the species and quantities caught.\n\nA commercial fishing enterprise may vary from one man with a small boat with hand-casting nets or a few pot traps, to a huge fleet of trawlers processing tons of fish every day.\n\nCommercial fishing gear includes weights, nets (e.g. purse seine), seine nets (e.g. beach seine), trawls (e.g. bottom trawl), dredges, hooks and line (e.g. long line and handline), lift nets, gillnets, entangling nets and traps.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the total world capture fisheries production in 2000 was 86 million tons (FAO 2002). The top producing countries were, in order, the People's Republic of China (excluding Hong Kong and Taiwan), Peru, Japan, the United States, Chile, Indonesia, Russia, India, Thailand, Norway, and Iceland. Those countries accounted for more than half of the world's production; China alone accounted for a third of the world's production. Of that production, over 90% was marine and less than 10% was inland.\n\nA small number of species support the majority of the world's fisheries. Some of these species are herring, cod, anchovy, tuna, flounder, mullet, squid, shrimp, salmon, crab, lobster, oyster and scallops. All except these last four provided a worldwide catch of well over a million tonnes in 1999, with herring and sardines together providing a catch of over 22 million metric tons in 1999. Many other species as well are fished in smaller numbers.\n\nFish farms\nMain article: Fish farm\nFish farming is the principal form of aquaculture, while other methods may fall under mariculture. It involves raising fish commercially in tanks or enclosures, usually for food. A facility that releases juvenile fish into the wild for recreational fishing or to supplement a species' natural population is generally referred to as a fish hatchery. Fish species raised by fish farms include salmon, carp, tilapia, catfish and trout.\n\nIncreased demands on wild fisheries by commercial fishing has caused widespread overfishing. Fish farming offers an alternative solution to the increasing market demand for fish.\n\n\nGyula Derkovits, still-life with fish (1928)\nFish products\nSee also: Fish processing, Fish products, Fish (food), and Seafood\nFish and fish products are consumed as food all over the world. With other seafoods, it provides the world's prime source of high-quality protein: 14‚Äì16 percent of the animal protein consumed worldwide. Over one billion people rely on fish as their primary source of animal protein.[36]\n\nFish and other aquatic organisms are also processed into various food and non-food products, such as sharkskin leather, pigments made from the inky secretions of cuttlefish, isinglass used for the clarification of wine and beer, fish emulsion used as a fertiliser, fish glue, fish oil and fish meal.\n\nFish are also collected live for research and the aquarium trade.\n\nFish marketing\nSee also: Fish market and Fish marketing\nFisheries management\n\nFishing down the food web\nMain articles: Fisheries management and Fisheries science\nFisheries management draws on fisheries science to find ways to protect fishery resources so sustainable exploitation is possible. Modern fisheries management is often referred to as a governmental system of (hopefully appropriate) management rules based on defined objectives and a mix of management means to implement the rules, which are put in place by a system of monitoring control and surveillance.\n\nFisheries science is the academic discipline of managing and understanding fisheries. It is a multidisciplinary science, which draws on the disciplines of oceanography, marine biology, marine conservation, ecology, population dynamics, economics and management in an attempt to provide an integrated picture of fisheries. In some cases new disciplines have emerged, such as bioeconomics.\n\nSustainability\nMain article: Sustainable fishing\nIssues involved in the long term sustainability of fishing include overfishing, by-catch, marine pollution, environmental effects of fishing, climate change and fish farming.\n\nConservation issues are part of marine conservation, and are addressed in fisheries science programs. There is a growing gap between how many fish are available to be caught and humanity's desire to catch them, a problem that gets worse as the world population grows.\n\nSimilar to other environmental issues, there can be conflict between the fishermen who depend on fishing for their livelihoods and fishery scientists who realise that if future fish populations are to be sustainable then some fisheries must limit fishing or cease operations.\n\nAnimal welfare concerns\nFurther information: Animal welfare and Pain in fish\nHistorically, some doubted that fish could experience pain. Laboratory experiments have shown that fish do react to painful stimuli (e.g., injections of bee venom) in a similar way to mammals.[37][38] This is controversial and has been disputed.[further explanation needed][39] The expansion of fish farming as well as animal welfare concerns in society has led to research into more humane and faster ways of killing fish.[40]\n\nIn large-scale operations like fish farms, stunning fish with electricity or putting them into water saturated with nitrogen so that they cannot breathe, results in death more rapidly than just taking them out of the water. For sport fishing, it is recommended that fish be killed soon after catching them by hitting them on the head followed by bleeding out or by stabbing the brain with a sharp object[41] (called pithing or ike jime in Japanese). Some believe it is not cruel if you release the catch back to where it was caught however a study in 2018 states that the hook used to catch causes damage to an important part of the feeding mechanism used to suck in food by the fish ignoring the issue of pain.[42]\n\nCultural impact\n\nOna, a traditional fishing village in Norway\n\nIndigenous Kaibarta woman with traditional fish catching device made from bamboo in Assam\nCommunity\nFor communities like fishing villages, fisheries provide not only a source of food and work but also a community and cultural identity.[43]\nEconomic\nSome locations may be regarded as fishing destinations, which anglers visit on vacation or for competitions. The economic impact of fishing by visitors may be a significant, or even primary driver of tourism revenue for some destinations.\nSemantic\nA \"fishing expedition\" is a situation where an interviewer implies they know more than they do to trick their target into divulging more information than they wish to reveal. Other examples of fishing terms that carry a negative connotation are: \"fishing for compliments\", \"to be fooled hook, line and sinker\" (to be fooled beyond merely \"taking the bait\"), and the internet scam of phishing, in which a third party will duplicate a website where the user would put sensitive information (such as bank codes).\nReligious\nFishing has had an effect on major religions,[44] including Islam,[45] Christianity,[46][47] Hinduism, and the various new age[48] religions. Jesus was said to participate in fishing excursions, and a number of the miracles and many parables and stories reported in the Bible involve fish or fishing. Since the Apostle Peter[49] was a fisherman, the Catholic Church has adopted the use of the fishermans ring into the Pope's traditional vestments.","notMiqote":true,"legend":2,"chocobo":"The chocobo","slimeRancher":"I like the game","gobbie":"FISH","cow1":"simmental","cow2":"guernsey","cow3":"brownSwiss","covid":"yes","comments":"I do play Tetris","balloons":true}

{"username":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Coming! Hang on a second. Hello? Barry? Adam? Can you believe this is happening? I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. You got lint on your fuzz. Ow! That's me! Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! Hey, Adam. Hey, Barry. Is that fuzz gel? A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive. You did come back different. Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. Hear about Frankie? Yeah. You going to the funeral? No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances. Well, Adam, today we are men. We are! Bee-men. Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15. That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick our job today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. Wonder what it'll be like? A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! That girl was hot. She's my cousin! She is? Yes, we're all cousins. Right. You're right. At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. What do you think he makes? Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. What does that do? Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Can anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! \"What's the difference?\" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Check it out. Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside The Hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. Hey, Jocks! Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! I wonder where they were. I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. Couple of Hive Harrys. Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! Oh, my! I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. Six miles, huh? Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. Maybe I am. You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? Well, there's a lot of choices. But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! Barry, you are so funny sometimes. I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! You're gonna be a stirrer? No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody \"dawg\"! I'm so proud. We're starting work today! Today's the day. Come on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... Is it still available? Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Congratulations! Step to the side. What'd you get? Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Couple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. You want to go first? No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. Any chance of getting the Krelman? Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? I'm going out. Out? Out where? Out there. Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. Look at that. Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. Thank you. OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! That's awful. And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. Antennae, check. Nectar pack, check. Wings, check. Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! Ever see pollination up close? No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Cool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those? Copy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Chemical-y. Careful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Candy-brain, get off there! Problem! Guys! This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Coming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. Should we tell him? I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There's a bee in the car! Do something! I'm driving! Hi, bee. He's back here! He's going to sting me! Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this. What was that? Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. You could put carob chips on there. Bye. Supposed to be less calories. Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Come on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? \"You like jazz?\" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. You're talking. Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. I'm talking with a bee. Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. Wait! How did you learn to do that? What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. \"Mama, Dada, honey.\" You pick it up. That's very funny. Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Can I... get you something? Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. It's just coffee. I hate to impose. Don't be ridiculous! Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? I shouldn't. Have some. No, I can't. Come on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. Where? These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, \"Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?\" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for The Hive, but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. You do? Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. Really? My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. Why do girls put rings on their toes? Why not? It's like putting a hat on your knee. Maybe I'll try that. You all right, ma'am? Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Can I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. Thanks! Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. Sounds amazing. It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. Do they try and kill you, like on TV? Some of them. But some of them don't. How'd you get back? Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your \"experience.\" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. Well... Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! No, no, no, not a wasp. Spider? I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. Her name's Vanessa. Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside The Hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? They call it a crumb. It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! You know what a Cinnabon is? No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ...really hot! Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! Thinking bee. Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! We're still here. I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! Then why yell at me? Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. Where are you going? I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. What is wrong with you?! It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got that down to a science. I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. I'll bet. What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? cute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? Is he that actor? I never heard of him. Why is this here? For people. We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? Well, yes. How do you get it? Bees make it. I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! It's organic. It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools,hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. You almost done? Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Crazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. And you? He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! What is that?! Oh, no! A wiper! Triple blade! Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Carl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! Bee! Moose blood guy!! You hear something? Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours. Bees hang tight. We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. What if you get in trouble? You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee! Hey, guys! Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit. What is this place? A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. Check out the new smoker. Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey, and we make the money. \"They make the honey, and we make the money\"? Oh, my! What's going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn't last too long. Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! Bee honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to humans. What? Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! Make out? Barry! We do not. You wish you could. Whose side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you want to do with your life? I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees! Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop. I remember that. What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one bee do? Sting them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! That would hurt. No. Up the nose? That's a killer. There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, The Hive's only full-hour action news source. No more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Chung. Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. And I'm Jeanette Ohung. A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally! Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, classy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think, \"I'm a kid from The Hive. I can't do this\"? Bees have never been afraid to change the world. What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. How old are you? The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century. You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too. It's a common name. Next week... He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em. Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81. Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. Is that that same bee? Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race. Hello. Hello, bee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working. But it's our yogurt night! Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours! Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help. Frosting... How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the competition. So why are you helping me? Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now. Those are great, if you're three. And artificial flowers. Oh, those just get me psychotic! Yeah, me too. Bent stingers, pointless pollination. Bees must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. Maybe this could make up for it a little bit. This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. I guess. You sure you want to go through with it? Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, \"Honey, I'm home,\" without paying a royalty! It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here, Barry? It's pretty big, isn't it? I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day. You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade. What's the matter? I don't know, I just got a chill. Well, if it isn't the bee team. You boys work on this? All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Case number 4475, Superior Court of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively? A privilege. Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world? I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids! Mr. Benson? Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice! Call your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have. I suppose so. I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron! Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms. Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term. I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you? No. I couldn't hear you. No. No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey. They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. You mean like this? Bears kill bees! How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. Where have I heard it before? I was with a band called The Police. But you've never been a police officer, have you? No, I haven't. No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! That's not his real name?! You idiots! Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow. I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir? Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now! This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella! Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?! Order in this court! You're all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! Say it! Mr. Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side. Are we doing everything right, legally? I'm a florist. Right. Well, here's to a great team. To a great team! Well, hello. Ken! Hello. I didn't think you were coming. No, I was just late I tried to call, but... the battery. I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. There's a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby. That's where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill. You think I don't see what you're doing? I know how hard it is to find the right job. We have that in common. Do we? Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out. That's just what I was thinking about doing. Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right. I'm going to drain the old stinger. Yeah, you do that. Look at that. You know, I've just about had it with your little Mind Games. What's that? Italian Vogue. Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages. A lot of ads. Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine? Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here! I love the smell of flowers. How do you like the smell of flames?! Not as much. Water bug! Not taking sides! Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat! This is pathetic! I've got issues! Well, well, well, a royal flush! You're bluffing. Am I? Surf's up, dude! Poo water! That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings! Kenneth! What are you doing?! You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it! We need to talk! He's just a little bee! And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time! Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life? No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them! Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night... My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster! Goodbye, Ken. And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man! I'm sorry about all that. I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it! I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well. Are you OK for the trial? I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas. We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers... Yeah. Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over. Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees. You got the tweezers? Are you allergic? Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? We're friends. Good friends? Yes. How good? Do you live together? Wait a minute... Are you her little... bedbug? I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children? Yeah, but... So those aren't your real parents! Oh, Barry... Yes, they are! Hold me back! You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson? He's denouncing bees! Don't y'all date your cousins? Objection! I'm going to pincushion this guy! Adam, don't! It's what he wants! Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way! Adam, stay with me. I can't feel my legs. What Angel of Mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed Turn Against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. Hey, buddy. Hey. Is there much pain? Yeah. I... I blew the whole case, didn't I? It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died. I'd be better off dead. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it. What was it like to sting someone? I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then...and then ecstasy! All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world. What will the humans do to us if they win? I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad. Adam, they check in, but they don't check out! Oh, my. Could you get a nurse to close that window? Why? The smoke. Bees don't smoke. Right. Bees don't smoke. Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking. That's it! That's our case! It is? It's not over? Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere. Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub. Mr. Flayman. Yes? Yes, Your Honor! Where is the rest of your team? Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time. I actually heard a funny story about... Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion. But you can't! We have a terrific case. Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? It's a bee smoker! What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee. Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, \"Smoking or non?\" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? What are we gonna do? He's playing the species card. Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! The court finds in favor of the bees! Vanessa, we won! I knew you could do it! High-five! Sorry. I'm OK! You know what this means? All the honey will finally belong to the bees. Now we won't have to work so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson. You'll regret this. Barry, how much honey is out there? All right. One at a time. Barry, who are you wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. What if Montgomery's right? What do you mean? We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years. Congratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement? First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine. We're all aware of what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take him out. He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine. And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames... But it's just a prance-about stage name! ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments. Can't breathe. Bring it in, boys! Hold it right there! Good. Tap it. Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups and there's gallons more coming! I think we need to shut down! Shut down? We've never shut down. Shut down honey production! Stop making honey! Turn your key, sir! What do we do now? Cannonball! We're shutting honey production! Mission abort. Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base. Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there. Oh, yeah? What's going on? Where is everybody? Are they out celebrating? They're home. They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in. I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket. At least we got our honey back. Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't? It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it. This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now... Now I can't. I don't understand why they're not happy. I thought their lives would be better! They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people. You don't have any idea what's going on, do you? What did you want to show me? This. What happened here? That is not the half of it. Oh, no. Oh, my. They're all wilting. Doesn't look very good, does it? No. And whose fault do you think that is? You know, I'm gonna guess bees. Bees? Specifically, me. I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things. It's not just flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees. That's our whole SAT test right there. Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom. And then, of course... The human species? So if there's no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn't it? I know this is also partly my fault. How about a suicide pact? How do we do it? I'll sting you, you step on me. That just kills you twice. Right, right. Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going. I had to open my mouth and talk. Vanessa? Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going? To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena. They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying. It's the Last Chance I'll ever have to see it. Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this. I know. Me neither. Tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports. Wait a minute. Roses. Roses? Roses! Vanessa! Roses?! Barry? Roses are flowers! Yes, they are. Flowers, bees, pollen! I know. That's why this is the last parade. Maybe not. Could you ask him to slow down? Could you slow down? Barry! OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault. Yes, it kind of is. I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you with the flower shop. I've made it worse. Actually, it's completely closed down. I thought maybe you were remodeling. But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined. I don't want to hear it! All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen. I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park. All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got. Bees. Park. Pollen! Flowers. Repollination! Across the nation! Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, California. They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy. Security will be tight. I have an idea. Vanessa Bloome, FTD. Official floral business. It's real. Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch. Thank you. It was a gift. Once inside, we just pick the right float. How about The Princess and the Pea? I could be the princess, and you could be the pea! Yes, I got it. Where should I sit? What are you? I believe I'm the pea. The pea? It goes under the mattresses. Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. I'm getting the marshal. You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco! Let's see what this baby'll do. Hey, what are you doing?! Then all we do is blend in with traffic... without arousing suspicion. Once at the airport, there's no stopping us. Stop! Security. You and your insect pack your float? Yes. Has it been in your possession the entire time? Would you remove your shoes? Remove your stinger. It's part of me. I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight. Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job. Can you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job! I think this is gonna work. It's got to work. Attention, passengers, this is Captain Scott. We have a bit of bad weather in New York. It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay. Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it. I gotta get up there and talk to them. Be careful. Can I get help with the Sky Mall magazine? I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer. Captain, I'm in a real situation. What'd you say, Hal? Nothing. Bee! Don't freak out! My entire species... What are you doing? Wait a minute! I'm an attorney! Who's an attorney? Don't move. Oh, Barry. Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain. Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit? And please hurry! What happened here? There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded. One's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious! Is that another bee joke? No! No one's flying the plane! This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status? This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York. Where's the pilot? He's unconscious, and so is the copilot. Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience? As a matter of fact, there is. Who's that? Barry Benson. From the honey trial?! Oh, great. Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee. It's got giant wings, huge engines. I can't fly a plane. Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot? Yes. How hard could it be? Wait, Barry! We're headed into some lightning. This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport, where a suspenseful scene is developing. Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory... That's Barry! ...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew. Flowers?! We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flight experience. Just a minute. There's a bee on that plane. I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres. They've done enough damage. But isn't he your only hope? Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all. Their wings are too small... Haven't we heard this a million times? \"The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense.\" Get this on the air! Got it. Stand by. We're going live. The way we work may be a mystery to you. Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you about a small job. If you do it well, it makes a big difference. More than we realized. To us, to everyone. That's why I want to get bees back to working together. That's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O. We get behind a fellow. Black and yellow! Hello! Left, right, down, hover. Hover? Forget hover. This isn't so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep! Barry, what happened?! Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time. That may have been helping me. And now we're not! So it turns out I cannot fly a plane. All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out! Move out! Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane! Don't have to yell. I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble. It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice! It's not a tone. I'm panicking! I can't do this! Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it! You snap out of it. You snap out of it. You snap out of it! You snap out of it! You snap out of it! You snap out of it! You snap out of it! You snap out of it! Hold it! Why? Come on, it's my turn. How is the plane flying? I don't know. Hello? Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there? The Pollen Jocks! They do get behind a fellow. Black and yellow. Hello. All right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop. Where? I can't see anything. Can you? No, nothing. It's all cloudy. Come on. You got to think bee, Barry. Thinking bee. Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something. What? I don't know. It's strong, pulling me. Like a 27-million-year-old instinct. Bring the nose down. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! What in the world is on the tarmac? Get some lights on that! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Vanessa, aim for the flower. OK. Cut the engines. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys? Affirmative! Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it. Land on that flower! Ready? Full reverse! Spin it around! Not that flower! The other one! Which one? That flower. I'm aiming at the flower! That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant pulsating flower made of millions of bees! Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up. Rotate around it. This is insane, Barry! This's the only way I know how to fly. Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern? Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse! Just drop it. Be a part of it. Aim for the center! Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman! Come on, already. Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly! Yes. No high-five! Right. Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower? What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius! Thank you. But we're not done yet. Listen, everyone! This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth. That means this is our Last Chance. We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this. If we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say? Are we going to be bees, or just Museum of Natural History keychains? We're bees! Keychain! Then follow me! Except Keychain. Hold on, Barry. Here. You've earned this. Yeah! I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves. Oh, yeah. That's our Barry. Mom! The bees are back! If anybody needs to make a call, now's the time. I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight! Here's your change. Have a great afternoon! Can I help who's next? Would you like some honey with that? It is bee-approved. Don't forget these. Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.  And I don't see a nickel! Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat! I had no idea. Barry, I'm sorry. Have you got a moment? Would you excuse me? My mosquito associate will help you. Sorry I'm late. He's a lawyer too? I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase. Have a great afternoon! Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get them anywhere. No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me. You're a lifesaver, Barry. Can I help who's next? All right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly. Thank you, Barry! That bee is living my life! Let it go, Kenny. When will this nightmare end?! Let it all go. Beautiful day to fly. Sure is. Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office. You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! Me? Hold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Can we stop here? I'm not making a major life decision during a production number! All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys. I had virtually no rehearsal for that.","fishingExperience":"fish\n\nfish\n\nfish","notMiqote":true,"legend":3,"chocobo":"choco dan","slimeRancher":"slime rancher is the BEST","gobbie":"Doom","cow1":"ansbach","cow2":"simmental","cow3":"holsteinFreisian","covid":"no","comments":"no","balloons":true}
{"username":"Souta \"has no chill\" suzuki","fishingExperience":"I began my long journey into FF fishing way back when going through A Realm Reborn for the first time. A bright eyed sprout, armed only with a cowboy hat and a dream, when I met the Ixali. At the time, I had no idea fishing was a thing! It had been hidden from me, and I had honestly not looked much for it. Just like in every other game with fishing though, it quickly sucked me in, from fishing for the Ixali, to fishing for the Namazu, to fishing for the sheer refusal to stop until I caught every fish in the sea.\n\nIt was then that I learned of the true horror that lurks beneath the waves, deep in the city of R‚Äôlyeh, where C‚Äôthulu lurks. The fish were the messengers of the eldritch terrors, scaly fiends who seek only to bring destruction to those who walk the surface.Thus, it is my duty as a fisherman to catch as many of them as I can to reduce their numbers. Only we can stop the never ending tide, the black waves of terror that these ichtyoid fiends seek to bring upon us from below, to wash over us all in a never ending eternity of tor- I mean, fishing is fun!\n\nThrough months of dedication and fishing while at work, I managed to catch every fish in the game except for Placodick. I am both an accomplished grandmaster caster, and a saint, and will soon even be a world-class troller if I find the time for more crying on the endeavor, and then I will just /playdead in water somewhere until they add more fish.\n\nAlso I'm a male Miqo'te, sorry.","notMiqote":true,"legend":0,"chocobo":"Fiera","slimeRancher":"Who doesn't love slimes, ranching slimes, and making new slimes with old slimes and weird food?
